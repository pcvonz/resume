### Work Experience
##### WWU ResTek Web & Print Designer (2014-2017)

- Collaborated with peers to create mock-ups for web applications for the housing department at Western Washington University. 
- Designed the front-end for web apps using Django. 
- Helped recruit and train new employees.

##### Bargreen-Ellingson Full Stack developer (2017-Current)
###### Sales analytics
**Tools used:** Python, Angular, EC2

- Worked on rendering a graph of earnings over the year for a custom subset of data
- Worked on a custom date picker to support submitting a query over a date range
- Mocked out UI/UX for key workflows.

###### Quote tool
- Developed the back-end in C# and front-end in React, deployed to AWS Lambda and S3
- Created a workflow for salespeople to import data from an invoice generator into our production database. The process validated items before creating an invoice with an easy UI. The workflow is now a key part of processing large batch orders.

###### Commissions calculator
**Tools used:** Javascript, React / Redux, Figma, Rollup

- Mocked up user flows for stakeholders to validate the process before development.
- Helped design and develop a component library in Rollup to re-use our components (selectors, tables, inputs) across the front-end. Added tests and Storybook to the project to make component documentation easier to find and changes easier to validate. 
- Helped design and create a visual programming tool that managers can use to create custom rules that determine the commission on invoices. The process improved the sales process for both managers and salespeople, making the commission process modern and easier to understand.

###### E-commerce website

- Developed with C#, Typescript, and React to create a custom e-commerce website that integrates cleanly with Bargreen's ERP system.
- Designed and implemented a new product catalog in ElasticSearch which syncs with Bargreen's product database using AWS SQS and Lambda. The catalog allows a custom subset of items to be displayed depending on which user is logged in. Helped implement features across the full stack including rendering the catalog, searching, and filtering items based on which properties items have.
- Helped create the product category menu so users can browse items based on which category they appear in. The menu is built depending on products in their catalog.
- Worked with docker and CircleCI to spin up an elastic search instance in CI to run integration tests to validate proper catalog generation. 
- Helped create the product details page that is rendered via NextJS to improve SEO performance and page load speed.
